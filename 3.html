  <p><strong>Last month, an <u>82-year-old on a bicycle was crushed</u> by a dump</strong>
   ruck outside a <a href="https://www.naver.com"target="_blank" title="네이버 주소">construction</a> site in Incheon. The driver, who claims to have been following a signalman’s order, said he had not seen
   the cyclist approaching from the side as he was making an exit from the site. A woman in her 70s in Gwangju is reportedly suffering from severe injuries after being hit
   y a sedan when she was jaywalking.</p>
